# Linux Hotkey Slot Fix
A fix for hotkeying to 2 or 6. Made specifically for Ubuntu. [And yes I am late]

| Minecraft Version | Mod Version |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1.7.10            | 1.0         |
| 1.8.9             | 1.0         |
| 1.9.4             | 1.0         |
| 1.12.2            | 1.0         |

## Why should you use it?
It might be useful when you want to Shift and Hotkey to your Item Slots. [Its a Lwjgl 2 issue.]

This bug was fixed in 1.13 and later.
